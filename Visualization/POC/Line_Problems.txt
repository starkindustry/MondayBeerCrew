problems with drawing lines:

extending SVG element for orbit so that line can draw to other orbits
	- each orbit is an svg element

Solutions? 
- have background svg to make a coordinate system, draw lines in background?
	Problems: May have problems with overlapping elements...could make this coordinate svg on top of everything?
- adjust orbit SVGs so that they reach other orbits
******- have separate SVG for lines


cannot append line to other elements except SVG?
