It's Monday...where's the beer?

Testing: 
==============

For the analysis portion of the project, we have unit tests, including tests for each of the parsers, 
tests for the Fuser and tests for the output format required for our visualizer.  

For the visualizer, mock input csv files are used with limited amount of data and predictable visualizations, which were then visually inspected. 

(integration test, manual)
    Input: A small, dummy codebase for which you know roughly what the visualization should look like (like maybe even a single source file).
    Output: A visualization.
    Test: Look at the visualization and confirm that it looks/behaves as expected.
